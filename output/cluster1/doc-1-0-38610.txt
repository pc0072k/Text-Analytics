   Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of
   doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
   this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5
   different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
   a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
   for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?
   Just curious.

I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the
split groups, and it would make things easier for those of us
who are less omnivorous.  There is no "waste" in creating news
groups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problem
with only a few posts per week per group - I spend too much time
on this as it is.
