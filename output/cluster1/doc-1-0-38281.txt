	I just got my advance program and the "card in the back" is for the
	Exhibits Plus program -- the exhibits plus admission to a number of
	conference venues, including a special general session, "Behind the
	Scenes: Computer Graphics in Film."  Admission is not free, but is a
	nominal $30 (exhibits are open August 3 -- 5).

	To get a copy of the advance program, you can call 312-321-6830; the
	advance program itself is a good indication of the excitement of the
	conference!
