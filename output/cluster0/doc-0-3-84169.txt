                     Welcome to the Peace Run

                     You're invited to join in
                     a Global Relay Run... and
                     help light the Way.



                     ----  Why the Peace Run  ----

There's a new spirit in the Nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growing
belief in the possibility of true global peace.

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to
bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into
a reality in their own lives.

Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more
than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand -
join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe.
Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from
nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying
the message of brotherhood to all humankind.

Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path
for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the
flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will
shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.


		    ----  Making History  ----

The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-
throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-
Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern
and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and
Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;
and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.


		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----
             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----

The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -
Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and
entertainment personalities.

Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper
reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including
specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.

> "I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace and
reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live
amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human
family, God's family."  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
			  Nobel Peace Prize Winner


		   ----  How It All Works  ----

Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York
City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead
up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag
Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world
were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.

From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over
seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or
cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,
Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller
runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South
America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered:
31,000 miles.

>"The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate
the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear
about the event."  - Carl Lewis,
                     Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist


                  ----  Who's Behind It  ----

The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an
international running organization that believes sports can be a
powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team
puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class
ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.

The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador
Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,
offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless
world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.

The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit
organization based in the United States.


               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----

The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a
million participants. We're expecting even more people to join
Peace Run '93.

You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,
a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the
runners as they carry the Torch through your community.

You can also join local celebrities and government officials in
one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the
70-nation route.

Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time
you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.


		 ----  The Next Step is Yours  ----
