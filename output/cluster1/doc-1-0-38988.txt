Hello there!

A week ago a guy asked what a .SCO file was - well I researched a bit and foundout that it is just another RIX file. .SCI files are 320x200 files and .SCO files are 1024x768 files! alle the other formats (800x600, 640x480...) are also called something like .SC(character).

regards 
rued
