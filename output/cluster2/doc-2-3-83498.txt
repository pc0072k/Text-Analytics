Who said Christians want to conform to the teachings of Jesus?

"You are the light of the world. A city can't be hidden lying on a
mountaintop. Nor do people light a candle and cover it with a big
basket; they put it up on a tall candlestick where it can shine for
everyone in the house. That's how your light must shine in front of the
world, so that people see your good deeds and give credit to your Father
in the skies. Don't think I came to dissolve The Law [Torah aka First
Five Books] or The Prophets: [7 major plus 12 minor] I didn't come to
dissolve them, I came to fulfill them. I assure you, till the sky and
the earth go away, not one letter or punctuation mark of The Law will
ever go away until everthing has come to pass. So anyone who dissolves
even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way,
will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas anyone
who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as someone
great in the kingdom of the skies."  Matt5:14-19, Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2
