	This morning on CNN (tues April 27), Texas Cops say Arson is suspected
	because of two falsh points. CNN also stated that  _all_ surviors
	claim the fires are FBI set.  Your argument are made-up, untrue
	and unverified at best.

    The day of the attack the FBI claimed to have seen two BD'ers setting
    the fire outside of the compound. Yesterday, the arson squad said two 
    flash points at the or near the tank entry points

    Not good evidence for the FBI hit squad.

  is there a difference between thinking that you won't survive a confrontation
  with the FBI (parnoia?) and committing suicide?

	No, claimed by the escapees  not contradicted

	What I'm finding interesting is the conflicting reports. FBI says
	that bodies have been found with bullet wounds and the Texas Cornuers
	(sp) says that they haven't yet found any bullet holes..
