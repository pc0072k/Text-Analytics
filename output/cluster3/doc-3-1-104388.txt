my understanding was that ted turner (owner of the braves) started running
his tv station nationwide, and started running all of his team's games on
his nationwide tv station, he dubbed his team ''america's team'' - that is,
the only team (at least, at the time) all of whose games could be seen
across america.

now, wor is nationwide out of beautiful secaucus, but not all mets games
are on wor.  wgn chicago and wsbk boston are two other superstations
(at least, they are on the east coast).  i don't know how many
cubs/sox/sox games they show.
