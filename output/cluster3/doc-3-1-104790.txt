Didn't Mike Schmidt also do this at least three times?  I can 
remember twice in Wrigley Field alone...he did it the same day
Kong did it in a 23-22 shootout, and he swatted four there one
day in April '76 (the month he set the April record with 11 HR's.
Anybody remember any of this?  (I was just a kid)
