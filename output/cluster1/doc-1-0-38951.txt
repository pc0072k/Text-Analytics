I use Arts & Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences
it traces beautifully. BUT - there's a trick to tracing. I've traced entire
cartoon images into custom clip art, but you can't expect to just point to
the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases
a lot of work). You need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it 
together... it's kinda hard to explain in type, but if you're ever in Reno
I can give you a little demonstration!
