How incredibly fucking stupid.  Of *course* the text is referring to the city
itself (buildings, bricks, mortar, etc.)  Otherwise it makes no sense to
refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a _place_ to spread 
fishing nets.

Is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you *won't* do to preserve 
your faith from admission of error, DeCenso?
