His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury
received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series.
It may also be him pressing a little.

As for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford.
Dent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game
against Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher.
