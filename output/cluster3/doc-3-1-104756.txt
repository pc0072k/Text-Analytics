There's nothing wrong with a red neck.  Why, some of us hicks even
listen to cultured music and such, can you say the same?  Aside from
that, you shouldn't try to shit on this guy by insulting where YOU
think he comes from.  Where I'm from, we milk cows, drive trucks, and
yes, even like baseball.  So screw anyone that doesn't like it.

Oh yeah, learn the difference between to and too city-boy! (see below)
