Yes a flotation tank, combined with floride breathing water(REF: the Abyss
breathing solution I think).. also the right position of the astronaut and
strapping you can probably get much more than 45gs in an accesloration..
More like near 100g (or somewhat less)..

Saw I book called the "Time Master" (I thjink that was the title) that had some
ideas on how fast and all you could go..
