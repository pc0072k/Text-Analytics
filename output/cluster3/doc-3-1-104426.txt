Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the 
fact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no "kncukle"
to his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff.  I wonder if 
Reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the
lineup, who also suddenly came alive those two games.
