All right. I'm not and won't be lawyer. What about doctors?
I going to fly aeroplane (or drive car). Doctors have to look for different

They have burden of proof that "harmful illnesses don't exist in me",
do they ?

(I'm just questioning my belief that believers have the burden of proof.)

: Please, not Pascal!  NOOOOO!! ;)
Oh!  Are you those bug-generator C-programmers  ? :-)
Turbo Pascal is the BEST and FASTEST for edit-run-edit-run cycles !
