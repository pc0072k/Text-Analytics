I DID NOT WRITE THAT!  In fact, those statements were a rebuttal to
an earlier posting that I made, and this was culled from my *strong*
rebuttal to those statements.  PLEASE!  Slander.  Shame.

"after the game, it's no big deal" ????   After the employees leave
the workplace, it doesn't matter what they say about the boss or the
company?  Puhlease.

First, it's Ross Porter.  Second, I am really tired of seeing the kind
of response that indicates that all I do is parrot what some media
person says or writes.  I have a brain.  If I choose to characterize
something in a certain fashion, it's because that is what I believe
to be accurate.  It is not just because some unnamed "mediot" made
the characterization.

I did *not* brand Darryl's response as petulant, because I never heard
any response from Darryl.  I did call him a name.  I referred to him 
as a primadonna.  Someone else concluded that I did that because I
"hate" him.  I don't hate him.  I think he's a primadonna.  If you
disagree, fine.  But stop putting words in my mouth.
