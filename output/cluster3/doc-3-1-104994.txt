In regard to Boggs:  I'll relate a story about a Yankee fan at Fenway last year
for opening day.  I was there to see them face Baltimore and couldn't help but
listen to the Boston fans talk about various players on the team.  One guy was
totally obliterating Boggs, how he sucks, etc....  I told him I was a Yankee
fan and I'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back.  He
said a pile of sh*t.  I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for
Boston, but come on he's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed
dimension to the Yanks.  A solid hitter, a decent fielder and more importantly
a teacher, ask Pat Kelly.  I think he's got a few good years left in his bat
and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League
East this year.  Boston fans have no class!!!  They'll probably boo him like
crazy his first time back in pinstripes and I hope he goes 4 for 4 and shuts
them up.
