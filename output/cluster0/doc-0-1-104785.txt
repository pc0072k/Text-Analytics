I AGREE, LUMBERJACK (except that they're in 2nd)!  They ARE going PLACES -
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Denver, Atlanta, Miami,
Philadelphia, New York, Montreal, Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis...and
points in between.  :-)

But,
THEY'RE 0-3 AT HOME!

I'm just not used to an overly enthusiastic Houston fan.  I really shouldn't
discourage it, so HANG IN THERE, LUMBERJACK!  (But, get ahold of that shift
key, will ya?)

ObBase:  Apparently the new owner (Drayton McLain (sp?)) doesn't particularly
like excuses.  An item in our paper (the Austin American-Statesman - "If you
read it here, it was somewhere else first") said that he wouldn't take 
injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been
accounted for.  Uh, oh.  I don't want an owner that'll keep everybody on
edge - I'd never gotten that feeling about him, but who knows?  Does 
anybody down there in the Houston area have a feel for how meddling of an
owner McLain is going to be?
