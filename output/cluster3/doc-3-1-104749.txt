Please pardon my ignorance if this is well known, but what is the current

Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make,
and award a balk if he exceeds it.  I'd have another question:  who would 
operate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?

I'm not sure I like this idea.  I think it would severely diminish the 
number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic
ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).

Ahhh!  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key,
eh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.

>The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows

It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the 
pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,
so he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of 
sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness
that could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some
disadvantages to that idea too.

I remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's
box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  That may be a little 
harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the 
batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound
their shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in the
batter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.
