I also heard the Romans had a large Solar festival on this day because this
day, about 3 days after the Winter Solstice, was when you could notice a
change in the shadows and be sure that the Sun was indeed returning. In fact,
I remember the latin phrase Natalis Solis Invicti (sp!) associated here.

I can't say for certain when Saturnalia was, since I can't locate my Master
Holiday List. I think it was 2 weeks or so however.
