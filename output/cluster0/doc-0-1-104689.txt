I had heard the rumors about LA, Cin, Hou, and SD all being
interested in Mark Davis, so it doesn't surprise me that a
team had to give up something and cash to actually get him.

Lynch "MOB"

ps.  anyone else draft this guy?  i really did and got a 
     loud cry of "when will you ever give up on this guy" :-)
