Not to mention that Lankford had been hurt two nights before running
into the outfield wall. This being the reason he was available to pinch-
anything.  His ribs were the problem so he could run but not hit.
Torre is no white rat but give him credit for what he is , a pretty darn
good manager. with the exception of the Felix fiasco, but i'm not sure  
who's brainchild that was.
