Well ...
Have a look at a new journal: Journal of Experimental Mathematics
It has several Fields medallists on its editorial board.
You want to knwo more?
Try Klaus Peters in Boston or David Epstein at Warwick .

-- 
Deep ideas are simple.
                      Odd groups are even.
                                           Even simples are not.
