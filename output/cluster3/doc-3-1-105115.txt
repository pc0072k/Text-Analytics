Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but
really, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  The first out of the game
was the front end of a double play.  Still counts as a back-end perfect
game in my book, though. 

Congrats to Chris Bosio.  Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him.
