Please cite your evidence that he was intending to use it.

Why not?

|If so, tell me where you live so I can be sure to steer well clear.

Check the sig.

Society does not have rights only individuals have rights.

|Go ahead, call me a commie,

OK, your a commie.

You think you have a right to rape anyone? No wonder you don't care about
the rightws of others.

|He broke the law,

Please indicate which law you feel Koresh broke, and when was he convicted of
said crime.

|he was a threat to society,

So you feel that owning guns makes him a threat to society. When are y ou
going to start going after knives and baseball bats as well.
Or do you feel that someone who spouts unpopular ideas is by definition a
threat to society.

|they did there job - simple.

It is simple if you think that there job is to assualt civilians.

|I'll support them all (except no. 2)

In other words you don't support any of them.
