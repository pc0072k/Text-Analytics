And from whence does this right stem, that it overrides the 'rights'
of the rest of us?

And if you want to view that television station, you have to watch the
commercials.  You can't turn them off and still be viewing the
television station.  In other words, if you don't like what you see,
don't look.  There is no 'right' I can think of that you have to force
other people to conform to your idea of aesthetic behaviour.  What's
next, laws regulating how people must dress and look so as to appeal
to your fashion sense, since you have this 'right' of an aesthetic
view?

Which has what to do with the topic of discussion?

Oh, I see.  You don't want any legislation that might impinge on you;
you just want everyone else on the planet to do what you want.
