Correct, we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.

Therefore, we can't tell whether they're slightly extra solar

 gamma ray burster       know it real close like
slight extra solar parallax measur burst  correct
parallax measur burst  therefor can't tell whether
they'r slight extra solar   mean parallax can't
tell whether it real close   phil fraer seem like
everi day find sort stuff
