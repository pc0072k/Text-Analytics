If you were able to prove that morality is objective, then it would
be correct to do so. The problem is, by the very meaning of the
words in question, to do so is oxymoronic. Of course you could
redefine the words, but that would still not lend support to the
underlying concept.

This does not parse. How could you hardly be wrong without dragging
in the o-word?

I have no problem with objectivity at all. It is my objectivity that
has led me to conclude that morality is subjective.
