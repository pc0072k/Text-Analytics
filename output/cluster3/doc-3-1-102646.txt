You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin
to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention.

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible.  So was his sophomore year.

National League pitchers are "much better pitchers"?  That certainly explains
Sheffield's 1993, hm?  Are you confusing "have ERA's that are 0.40 lower
because they don't face DH's" with "much better"?
