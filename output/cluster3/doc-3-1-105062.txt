Yes, the stance is new.  Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last
year, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres
has a "weak" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the
ball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.  But the
change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago.  His
selectivity has not changed.
