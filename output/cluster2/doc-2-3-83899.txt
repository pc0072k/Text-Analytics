A lot of people won't agree with me.  That's their right and I respect that.
However, to the point, Jews are also covered by the saving grace of Jesus
Christ.  There are Jews who have become Christians.

This brings up another question I still have to ponder:  why is there so 
much anti-Semitism?  Why do people hate Jews?  I don't hate Jews.  I consider
them to be like anyone else, sinners we all are.
