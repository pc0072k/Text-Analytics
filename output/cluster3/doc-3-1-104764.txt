Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football.
Last year I hardly watched a game.  What turned me off were the
incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores.
2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.
Three downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!

Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I
believe institutionalize slow play.  I don't mind the cat-and-mouse
game with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly
I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What
I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,
or when the game is a blowout.  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off 
the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter
steps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to
is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.
When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders
and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the
delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the
commercial breaks in football.  

I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up"
the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move
the markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address
the problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the
sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything
to enhance the experience of the fans.

Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the
ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly
long periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching
the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone
watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an
opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that
was present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would
eliminate that aspect of baseball.

On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful
enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they
are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games 
out the way that they do.  I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting
there.
