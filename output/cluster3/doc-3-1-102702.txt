Jason, I am going to a yankee game wed night at cleveland stadium. I am so  
happy.


But Cleveland is a very bad team who lost severalrs. They were an up and  
coming team, now they are just a sad excuse for a better average.



ABBOT WILL NOT WIN THE CY.!!!!!! MELIDO PEREZ WILL. as bold a prediction  
as they come., Well herOT be in last place by the end of the season. Mike  
lurie Speaks, and the world listens.
