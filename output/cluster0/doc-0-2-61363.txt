Back in January and February there were several articles (Wash Post, Time...)
saying that NASA was "considering" the option just as it is now "considering"
a followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission.  However, the
down time was estimated to be a year+ (servicing, checkout, sceheduling
and training another shuttle, orbit verification...) and to be quite
expensive.  I think it may have been more a mental exercise than a
real plan.  Don't know.
