Of course,  they then  turn up the REverb, the Gain,  add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box.  I'd think they wouldn't notice the
distortion.   Oh I forgot the phase shifters.

Ah,  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems :-)

 solid state tube analog        also ask electr
guitar enthusiast type amp prefer they'll tell
tube type sinc tube lower distort nois transistor
cours electr guitar type say tube sound better
dude   cours turn reverb gain add analog delay
line fuzz box i'd think wouldn't notic distort
forgot phase shifter  also transistor advantag
wast heat energi use main heater cathod tube
