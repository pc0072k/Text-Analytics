nice woofing (or should i say meowing?).
and yes, the Tiggers are a fun, exciting team that i would pay to see.
but last year, they went 75-87. this year, their offense is essentially
the same, and their pitching is, at best, essentially the same. so why
do you think they will suddenly improve to win the 92 or so games which will
be required to win the A.L. East? what has changed that i don't see?

remember, a 20-4 win is worth as much in the standings as a 3-2 win...
