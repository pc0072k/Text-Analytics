Subject: Where can I find baseball statistics ??

I am interested in uncovering statistics on Boston Red Sox players from
March 1992 - present.  I want to look at changes in batting average, hits,
multi-hit games, runs, stolen bases, and on base % during
every game.  Where can
I find this information?  Do any sports magazines log this info or do I
have to go directly to the ball club?
Thanks for the info.  Kip
