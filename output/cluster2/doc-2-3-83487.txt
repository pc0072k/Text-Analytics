Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of
scripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about
(a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective
morality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.
