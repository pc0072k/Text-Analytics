a) Dominican
b) not all that light-hitting.  .304 lifetime, .315 or so in 1966-73
when he did most of his playing.  
c) Professional pinch-hitter after that.  Yes, that also gives you
Jerry Hairston.

Beginning 10th year now.

>Herm Winningham.

Good one.

>Lonnie Smith (not light hitting, but a horror in the field)

Not the same thing.  LOTS of people are bad OFs.

>Gary Redus

Not all that light either.  .750 OPS.

>Dion James

Not 10 year.

>Daryl Boston

10-year this year.

>Vince Coleman (yeah, he's finally started to have a decent OBP)

Not 10-year.  

>Cecil Espy

Not 10-year.

>Willie Wilson

Yup.

>Gary Pettis

OK.

>Milt Thompson

10-year this year.

>Gary Varsho

*Six*-year this year.

Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith);
that seems to be a special class.  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get 
more of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well.  And Brock
wasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he 
spoiled his ifetime .300 BA.

And again, I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time.  But if
you look at the history of the last three decades, there seems to 
be a clear race-based pattern by which utility players and platoon
players and lesser talents stayed in the ML far longer if they were
white.

>Cesar Cedeno. 

Light hitting?  199 HR, .793 lifetime OPS mainly with *HOUSTON*?
Also Latin, btw.

>Likewise for my list. Oh, and a prediction: Milt Cuyler.

Come back in 1999 and we'll party^H^H^H^H^H talk.
