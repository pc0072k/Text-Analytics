	You are absolutely correct.  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of
bandwagoners.  Correct me if I am wrong, but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give
away a ticket to see the Braves play.I  would bet my next paycheck that 80% of
the so-called Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not
name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. On the other hand, ask any
Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name 3 players from any given
year and 80% of them probably could.
	Granted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but
that does not mean they diserve the title "America's Team"
	The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted
Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation.
	I'll consider Toronto AMerica's team before the Braves


	GO REDS!
