It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.
It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker.

If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was
"Pitching and defense win championships", and later "Pitching is the essence
of baseball".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was "your 
point", and neither of which is true.

And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?

>This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
>(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low 
>scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  

It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-
scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

>They should have many 
>low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
>On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
>I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.

I thought you said "pitching and defense win championships" and "pitching is
the essence of baseball".
