	Would someone be kind enought to document the exact
nature of the evidence against the BD's without reference to
hearsay or newsreports. I would also like to know more about
their past record etc. but again based on solid not media
reports. 

	My reason for asking for such evidence is that last night
on Larry King Live a so-called "cult-expert" was interviewed from
Australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the
original raid. This admission, if true, raises the nasty
possibility that the Government acted in good faith, which I
believe they did, on faulty evidence. It also raises the
possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising
them and giving ver poor advice.

	A few years ago Anson Shupe and David Bromley published
STRANGE GODS: THE GREAT AMERICAN CULT SCARE (Beacon, Boston, 1981
- and THE NEW VIGILANTES: ANTI-CULTISTS AND NEW RELIGIONS -Sage,
Beverly Hills, 1980. Both books suggested the possibility of
tragic results if self-proclaimed cult experts were ever taken
seriously. Perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movement
needs investigating in light of the Waco tragedy.
