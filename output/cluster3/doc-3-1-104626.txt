According to the Atlanta paper, Bream will be the full-time first baseman
with Klesko used as a late-inning defensive replacement if Bream is lifted
for a pinch-runner. He'd have to hit a homer in his first AB (or win the
game or do some other amazing thing) to be rewarded with a start so he could
even attempt to push Hunter or Bream out of the lineup.
