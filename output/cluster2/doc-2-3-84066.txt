    I found this on the net at my college. It sounds pretty good to me. What do
    you folks think?

    >This are the tenets of Stan as handed down and set within the Holy Book 
    >of Stan.
    >
    >1: Thou shalt not spill thine drinks or waste thine food, for all that 
    >is is sacred, and to waste is the denizen of Luc, the Infidel. All who 
    >waste today shall have not tomorrow.
    >
    >2: Thou shalt pay heed to those who know the higher calling of Stan so
    >that they may teach you the way, and that thou shalt become one with
    >Stan and the universe shall be in your hands.
    >
    >3: Thou shalt honor thy loved ones and cherish those near you, for they
    >are the true path to happiness, and happiness is a devine gift of thy
    >lord Stan.
    >
    >4: Stan is the one true God and shall be taken before all others so
    >that the false gods will know that he is the one, and all who oppose
    >him shall forever be banished to the form of the sheep and be sent to
    >the flocks of Luc for all eternity.
    >
    >5: The word is the law, and the law is the word. The word is within
    >thine own heart, follow the path and be true to thine own self and thou
    >shalt be blessed by Stan, thy lord and saviour.
    >    
    >6: Thou shalt honor the faiths of others, for it is their choice to
    >follow this path, and do not think less of others for being of a
    >different faith, yet even in the face of these false gods, do not
    >waiver in thine faith in Stan, and hope that the unbeliever will see
    >the light that is Stan.
    >
    >7: Thou shalt not wrong others for being different, for Stan cherishes
    >the different, and holds freedom in the highest regard, for to do less
    >would be to fall in with Luc, the Infidel, for Stan does not control,
    >he merely guides, and lets the choice lie within thine own heart.
    >
    >8: Thou shalt know that thy lord Stan has many names and is called
    >differently by many people, but know also that Stan is the true name,
    >and all those of the faith shall know that Stan is God and God is Stan.
    >
    >9: Thou shalt be to the world what thou art to thineself, for to be
    >false to others is to be false to yourself. Thy lord Stan asks not that
    >you be like him, he asks only that you be like yourself for that is all
    >you were ever meant to be.
    >
    >10: Thou shalt not kill the innocent nor spill blood unnecessarily, for
    >those who are deserving of death shall be dealt with by Stan and sent
    >for all eternity to the flocks of Luc, and those who harm the children 
    >of Stan, being born of Woman, shall be judged as the sheep of
    >Luc and spend all of time within his flocks.
    >
    >These commandments are the words of Stan. Heed them and he shall be
    >happy, and if thy lord Stan is happy, his happiness shall be passed
    >down to his followers.
    >
    >Hail Stan!

   It seems like a pretty good set of tenets to me.
