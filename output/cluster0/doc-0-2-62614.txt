well it seemed to work for the Mac II installation I was talking about.
Oh yeah there is something I forgot to mention :
even though you're not suppposed to have water around, there IS
 some condenstion d
dripping from the roof of the plane make sure that your hardware is covered.
Make also sure that your keyboards are protected from the two-phase flow
coming out of sick people. It happened to us.....

Good luck.
