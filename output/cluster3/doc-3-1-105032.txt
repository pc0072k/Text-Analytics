The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked. I was also at
the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't
paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance
seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his
left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change
in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could
always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new
stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,

Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving
pitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!).
Does Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most
pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?
