}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for
}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a
}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?

Did I either ask or assert that?  Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again?

}Can you wait without whining? To pass the time, maybe you should go
}back and read the portions of my article that you so conveniently
}deleted in your reply.  You'll find most of your answers there.  

Nope:  In particular:

Example of telepathy?

>responding Jim's threa
What threat.  Produce it.

>Jim again, still mystified
More telepathy?  Or maybe just empathic telepathy, capable of determining emotional states.

>Jim, trying to
More telepathy.  How do you know "trying"?!?!?

>Jim, preparing to
Precognition?  Substantiate.
