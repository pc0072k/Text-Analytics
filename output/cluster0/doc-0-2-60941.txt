Subject: Jemison on Star Trek
Organization: Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon
Lines: 7

   I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr. Mae Jemison, the first
black woman in space (she's a physician and chemical engineer who flew
on Endeavour last year) will appear as a transporter operator on the
"Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode that airs the week of May 31.
It's hardly space science, I know, but it's interesting.
