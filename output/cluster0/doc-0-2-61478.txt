Doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more
propulsion capability than we can manage.  You would have to boost to
Pluto and then slow back down.  You could do something like a Hohman
orbit, but I think that would take ridiculous amounts of time (my
Rubber Bible is at home).

 satellit around pluto mission      wierd warn
plan put satellit around planet solar system keep
watch help better ask question spout opinion
mission unman pluto stay orbit record thing around
near pluto know strang idea could scan pluto also
solar system object near aaroundpluto well seti
look galaxi without much solar system worri  anyth
like reason time requir propuls capabl manag boost
pluto slow back could someth like hohman orbit
