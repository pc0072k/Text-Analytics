To split a split hair, I believe that teflon (-CF4- monomer) was
"discovered" by accident when someone I don't remember
found what he thought was a liquid (or gas?) had turned to a
solid...

It just happend to fit the bill for the above use...

I'm crossposting to sci.materials so perhaps someone in the know
might elaborate...
