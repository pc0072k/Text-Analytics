Hello everyone,

	I was hoping someone could help me out.  I'm writing a program
	for my astronautics class for assent of the shuttle into a low
	orbit.  There are two things I'd like to know, First, how much 
	time elapses between launch and the pitch over. Second, what is
	the cross-sectional area of the shuttle, srb's, and ext. tank.

	Thanks for any information, post or e-mail.

	Joel Belog
