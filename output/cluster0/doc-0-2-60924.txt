A good summary has been posted (thanks), but I wanted to add another comment.
I remeber reading the comment that General Dynamics was tied into this, in 
connection with their proposal for an early manned landing.  Sorry I don't 
rember where I heard this, but I'm fairly sure it was somewhere reputable. 
Anyone else know anything on this angle?

Hrumph.  They didn't send _me_ anything :(
