First, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches.

And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this
is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games
can grab and hold your attention much better.

Bring back the two-hour baseball game!  (And the three and a half hour
golf game with it!)
