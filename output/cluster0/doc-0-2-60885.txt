Subject: Why not give $1 billion to first year-long moon residents?
Organization: The MacInteresteds of Nashville, Tn.
Lines: 12

With the continuin talk about the "End of the Space Age" and complaints 
by government over the large cost, why not try something I read about 
that might just work.

Announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation 
who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. 
Then you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin 
to be developed. THere'd be a different kind of space race then!
