Sorry if this is late for the thread, but...

I thought God was supposed to be constant and never-changing.  How do
you reconcile this common Christian view with the paragraph above?

Also, while we're at it:

1. How do you reconcile "A KIND and LOVING God!!" with the
Judeo-Christian view that sin was at one time "immediately punishable
by death"?  Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing
KINDness and LOVE?

2. Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of
having made a mistake?

3. Now that we are "living in the age of grace", does this mean that
for our sins, God now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather
than killing us immediately?  If so, is this eternal damnation an
example of "A KIND and LOVING God!!"?

Just curious.
