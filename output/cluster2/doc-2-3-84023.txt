Like most religions, the doctrine has good and bad in it.  I would 
certainly reject the current implementations of the doctrine.
:
:No.  The above is a classic example of taking a scripture out of context.
:It's taken from Luke 22:36.  But note vs 37; "For I tell you that this
:which is written must be accomplished in me, namely, 'and he will be reckoned
:with lawless ones'...".  He then stated that two swords were enough
:for the group to carry to be counted as lawless.  

So having more than the politically correct number of weapons was
cause to be arresed and killed even then, huh?

:Jesus' overiding message was one of peace (turn other cheek; live by 
:sword die by sword; etc).

Yes, of course, as in Matthew 10:34-35 "Do not suppose that I have come to 
bring peace to the earth; it is not peace I have come to bring but a sword..."
