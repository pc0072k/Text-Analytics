These people were very silly.  Any team that gets to the World Series
can win the World Series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
crazy.  If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against
the worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game
most of the time and very well could win the Series, though the odds
would certainly be against them.
