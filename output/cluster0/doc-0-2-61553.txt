Of course,

	How many government projects after Using PERT, GANT, C.P.M.s
Process flow diagrams,  Level 5 software projects....  actually
come in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined
that 80% of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing
to adequately measure  engineering developement costs.   

Me, I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research.   I don't think the government should pour money
into any one sector,  but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art.  

THings like  High tech  construction projects,  apollo  was worth it for the doing.  Running hte national labs.  The SSC is grossly overweight,  but
is a reasonable project at a lower cost.  

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected.

Maybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PH'ds,  you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00   If you produce, you
can  qualify for other grants.  If you don't  you never get in again.

THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach,  and older  stale 
scientists don't dominate the process.
