I am pleased to announce that a *revised version* of _The Easy-to-Read Book
of Mormon_ (former title: _Mormon's Book_) by Lynn Matthews Anderson is now
available through anonymous ftp (see information below). In addition to the
change in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages
(eliminating many extraneous "that's" and "of's"), and many (minor) errors
have been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,
testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a "Words-to-Know"
glossary.

As with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a
not-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome
to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the
actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge
anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit
from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself
for the precise terms.

Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the
printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound
"first editions.") I will make another announcement about the availability
of printed copies once everything has been worked out.

FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then "cd
pub" (you won't see anything at all until you do).

"The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon" is currently available in postscript and
RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made
available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to
print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple
Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in
the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work
better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in
by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the
Macintosh and Windows. If you don't have a postscript printer, you may be
able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.
