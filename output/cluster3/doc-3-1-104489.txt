Yah.  So?

He certainly didn't earn his last one.  *HOW* many games did he blow
in the World Series?  All of the ones he started?

Oh, yes.  Definitely.  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens.

Don't give me that shit.  If Boston had Alomar, Olerud, Henke, and
Ward while Toronto had Rivera, Jack Clark, Jeff Reardon, things would
have looked a little different last fall.  Give credit where credit is
due.  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick.

I'm willing to bet they don't finish sixth.  I'm also willing to bet
they don't finish first.  And if you give me 3-2 odds, I'm willing to
bet that they finish ahead of the Blue Jays.
