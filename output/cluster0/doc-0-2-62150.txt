If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you
love vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is
a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying
it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform.

>We see "zero-defects operation" in many area|s of life.  

Not to this degree.

>Calling shuttle flight characteristics *bizarre* in the same post 
>as touting DC-X is interesting.  

Why?

>DC-X will also have similar "zero-defects" issues (am I wrong?).  

Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle
isn't reusable, it's salvagable).

>supersonic speeds.  

The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X
shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.

>How much in DC-X is redundant?  That's the real question.

The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available
thrust and still land safely.

>Everything we do in life has zero-defects issues at times (agree?).

Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.

>As a doctor, I can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations.  

You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You
wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you?

>While DC-X's R&D program makes good sense, I am less optimistic about DC-X 
>as you (and apparently others) are.  

You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it
will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO.

>But, DC-X will still have failures.  It is the nature of aerospace R&D.  

Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.

>It's successors are not slated to be passenger carrying.  

Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will
carry passengers.

>The impression I had

>was limited and the man-ratable version was decades away.

I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original
schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.

Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it.

>You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following:

The only way to prove those things is to build it.
