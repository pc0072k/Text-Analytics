	Whoa. Aren't you forgetting a couple of guys named Gant and Justice?

	He can lead off. He'll probably steal 40. He might hit .300. He'll
never hit 20+ homers. I think you went 2 for 4 on this one.
 
>bases... and they start guys like Nixon and Bream ahead

	You said it all right there. 

	Does anyone else out there not like Deon? I think he's all hype.
His .300 season last year was good, but I'm not convinced that he can do
it again. It reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987(?) when Tim Wallach hit
30 or so homers and had 127 RBI. It never even came close to happening 
again. Of course, maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business
and don't play it up for the attention. Just my HO.

Doug Roberts - Larry Walker is God. Delino Deshields thinks he is.
