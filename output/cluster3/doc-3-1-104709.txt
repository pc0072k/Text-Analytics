DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the
clubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it
was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry.
No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many
new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it.

(Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string)

Yet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent
they raved about at the beginning of last season.  I'm glad to see him
faring well for the Padres though.
