Subject: japanese moon landing?
Organization: PANIX Public Access Unix, NYC
Lines: 17

Afraid I can't give any more info on this.. and hoping someone in greter
NETLAND has some details.

A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
about how the Japanese, using what sounded like a gravity assist, had just
managed to crash (or crash-land) a package on the moon.

the article was very vague and unclear.  and, to make matters worse, I
didn't clip it.

does this jog anyone's memory?


thanks
dannyb@panix.com
