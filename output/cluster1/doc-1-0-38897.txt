From: lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com (LightWave 3D Mail List Administrator)
Subject: Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ
Lines: 130


----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------

-- WHAT IS LightWave? --

LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the "Toaster" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>

I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please
send a mail message to:

        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

The first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.
Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.
Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.



-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --

Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have
something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to
the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact
me at the address:

        lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com

Cheers,


Bob Lindabury
