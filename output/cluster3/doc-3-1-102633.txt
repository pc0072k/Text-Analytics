Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did 
Alomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,
Gwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the 
numbers don't count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers.
