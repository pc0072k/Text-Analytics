  i guess i ought not conclude from this, then, that since you didn't ask to
be created, you don't care if you go to hell.  :)

  i don't consider myself an unthinking sheep.  the bible says god created
us to be in communion and obedience to him.  the first and only rule was
to not eat of a certain tree, or else the punishment is distance from him
and physical death.  god's intention in creating us is to have a relationship
with us.  the bible documents god's attempts to have that relationship
culminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so
that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again: the purpose
of creation.

  who is god to impose rules on us?  he's god and he created us.  i suppose
he has a right based on who he is.  above you mention "In his infinite
wisdom", and that's what i'd say god exemplifies.  but if you were being
sarcastic up there, then this whole discussion is irrelevant, eh?  and if
we believe god is infinitely wise, that belief should inform our relationship
with him.
