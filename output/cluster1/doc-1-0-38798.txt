!Yes. I also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting
!hell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup.

I am also against splitting the group. The traffic will decrease
on any given subject but the required net bandwidth will INCREASE
because of multiply cross-postings.

I just went through this with another group I continuously read.
It is now almost at the point where it is no longer worth reading.

Strongly suggest NOT doing this.
