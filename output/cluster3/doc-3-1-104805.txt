Isn't Stark that idiot who writes in Baseball America?   Twice a month he
writes a "Who woulda thunk it" article which is really the same piece
every time.   "Who would have thought that [Buddy Biancalana] would have
more home runs than [the Colorado Rockies, Babe Ruth, Omar Vizquel and
Nolan Ryan] COMBINED!"   He's an idiot, if it's the same guy.
