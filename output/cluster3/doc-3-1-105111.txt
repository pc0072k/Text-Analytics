i guess so.
still, that's kind of a stupid move, IMO. he'd be singing a different
tune if he had booted it, and the next guy up had hit a bloop single.
stranger things have happened (hey, i used to be a big Dave Stieb fan...)
and unfortunately, there's no such thing as an "unearned hit". :^)

cheers,
