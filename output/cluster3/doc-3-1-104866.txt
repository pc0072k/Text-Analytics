>>Otis Nixon.

Stole 300 bases.  (Ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't
think so, they think he, like Omar Moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff
man.  Awesome defense.)

>>Darnell Coles

He's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR.

>>Henry Cotto

Hasn't played 10+ years in the bigs.  Wasn't a full-time major-leaguer
until 1988.

>Manny Mota.

Consistent .300 hitter.

>Billy Hatcher

We'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.

>Herm Winningham.

Same goes for Herm.

>Lonnie Smith (not light hitting, but a horror in the field)

Doesn't count then.

>Gary Redus

Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  Close to
800 OPS career against LHP.

>Dion James

We'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify.

>Daryl Boston

Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'
parks in the NL.  He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this
year.  Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver
and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox.

>Vince Coleman (yeah, he's finally started to have a decent OBP)

Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being
weak offensively, though of course he was.  Led NL in SB his first six
years in the majors.

>Cecil Espy

We'll see if he's still around in 1997.

>Willie Wilson

Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year
stretch and led the league in triples five times.  But we can count him
if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon
deluxe with slightly worse defense.

>Gary Pettis

Okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also
in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome.

>Milt Thompson

He's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.

>Gary Varsho

Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.

>OK, I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook, but
>only after the first 7 or 8. Oh, and there's the all-time light-hitting
>black outfielder: Lou Brock. Look it up. And Curt Flood. Cesar Geronimo.
>Cesar Cedeno. 

Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as
light-hitting.  Neither was Curt Flood.  Cesar Cedeno was *not* light-
hitting.

>>Note:  These guys may not have reached 10 years yet, but they've got

>Likewise for my list. Oh, and a prediction: Milt Cuyler.

He'll have to steal a lot more bases.
