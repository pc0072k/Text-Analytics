	No: It is old. You said AMORC *IS*, not *was*... :-)
Nothing personal, OK? Good! :-)

	Maybe you didn't know that it's over by now. There is no more
pending legal actions from no where, period. So yes, there was a
situation and it has been resolved by BOTH parties. As long as humans 
handle anything, it is subjected to "breaking" :-)

	BTW, Gary L. Stewart has a P.O. Box in TX calling his org ARC:
Ancient Rosae Crucis. I guess he couldn't take the "MO" from AMORC :-)
