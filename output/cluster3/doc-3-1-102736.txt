morgan and guzman will have era's 1 run higher than last year, and
 the cubs will be idiots and not pitch harkey as much as hibbard.
 castillo won't be good (i think he's a stud pitcher)

       This season so far, Morgan and Guzman helped to lead the Cubs
       at top in ERA, even better than THE rotation at Atlanta.
       Cubs ERA at 0.056 while Braves at 0.059. We know it is early
       in the season, we Cubs fans have learned how to enjoy the
       short triumph while it is still there.
