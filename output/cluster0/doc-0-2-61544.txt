I don't know what you mean by 'edged', but surely there are two other
possibilities for an isotropic distribution: near interstellar (up to
~100 pc, i.e. within the disc), or the Galaxy's corona?

"Among the gods, there is a dispute as to which one of them originally
thought of Christianity; or, as they call it, the Great Leg Pull.  Apollo
has the best claim, but a sizeable minority support Pluto, ex-God of the
Dead, on the grounds that he has a really sick sense of humour." (Tom Holt)
