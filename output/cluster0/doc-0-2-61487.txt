 Let me get this right - sorry, try again.  Let me get this straight - 
well maybe that too is a poor choice of words - someone might think 
I'm pushing a gay agenda.  How about:  let me try to understand this 
by re-phrasing it as an extreme.  I, as a minority of one, have no right 
to a beautiful world.  You, on the other hand have the right to make an 
ugly one because you presume to speak for all the rest.  And I cannot 
complain.  Curious.

And do you want everyone to do as you wish (insist on putting something 
up that will impact everyone for selfish reasons) _without_ any legislation?  
And no one else can even object?  Somehow I think this whole shoving 
contest has gotten way off the track.  I'm ready to let this thread 
die a quick and merciful death.
