Yes, that's him.  Was I not specific enough?

Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that
they have a quick bat.  Dawson's release is slow, and he *IS* 38, after
all.  He may swing early, and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to 
the left side all the time, but he swings slowly.

As for me disagreeing with Peter Gammons... Whoa!  That's never happened
before!  Next thing you know, I'll probably believe Dave Campbell is the
biggest imbecile even to come near a mic, and that Ray Knight has
the IQ of drained crankcase oil.
