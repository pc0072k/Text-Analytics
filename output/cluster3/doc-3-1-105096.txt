	No way -- gotta be Walter Johnson.  All were with Washington.
Carlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there.

>With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.

	I'd also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect 
Bobby Witt wasn't far behind.  Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close....

>In the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least
>a hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.)
>Then maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK)

	Fingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so, yes,
I'd go with that guess.  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better
chance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100 
with MON.

>Don't know about the homers/steals dept.

	Gotta be Willie Mays...I am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his
career.

>In some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least
>the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too.  Probably Seaver
>and Koosman fit too.

	Hmmm...Leary is a really good point.  I'd forgotten about him.  Well,
if nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of
"could have lost to all teams" -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver....
I guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or
Koosman.
