>>      Hmmm. I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record-
>>players and radios in the 1960s wasn't better performance but lower
>>per-unit cost than vacuum-tube systems.

I'd buy that for two reasons.  The tubes for TV's and radios (if you can
still find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors.

Also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and
they'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors.  'Course, most of your electric guitar types just say
"Tubes sound better, dude." :-)

Also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use,
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.

davi nicol sez hmmm seem recal attract solid state
record player radio 1960s wasn't better perform
lower per unit cost vacuum tube system  i'd buy
two reason tube tv radio still find usual expens
compar transistor  also ask electr guitar
enthusiast type amp prefer they'll tell tube type
sinc tube lower distort nois transistor cours
electr guitar type say tube sound better dude
also transistor advantag wast heat energi use main
