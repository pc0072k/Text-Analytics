Subject: How Can I Download Files/Graphics?
Organization: Wetware Diversions, San Francisco
Lines: 21

How can I find these files and graphics that people
are downloading from their Unix systems? Then, how
do I download them? I am a complete beginner in
this (obviously), so please baby-step me through
the process. First of all, I don't see amongst
these newsgroups where there is anything remotely
like a GIF, TIF, or compiled shareware program?

Thanks in advance for any information you can
give me. (I know there is a Unix command, "ftp,"
that will allow me to do this, but first I
need to know where to go to find the file
I want download via ftp, etc.
