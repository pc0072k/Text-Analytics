Could be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate 
and also for Baseball America.

Stark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was "projected" 
to be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
150 times.

Stark does some really funny stuff. His weekly baseball reviews are good 
collections of strange things that happened during the previous week. He 
also regularly prints Kinerisms.
