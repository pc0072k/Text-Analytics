Subject: Red Sox Choke Contest
Organization: Computer Science & Engineering, U. of Washington, Seattle
Lines: 21

To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a 
contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current 
heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again
at any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:

(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or

(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.

So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you 
were serious, Val!).

ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was
in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.

So email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directly
replying to this post.
