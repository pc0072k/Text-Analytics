Ok all you trivia buffs, I have a good one for you.

1.  Prior to the foul bunt rule what is the record for the most foul balls
by 1 batter during one at bat?

2.  Total pitches?

3.  Who was the batter?

4.  Who was the pitcher?

5.  Same as 1-4 except after the foul bunt rule.

Associated data would be nice too (such as date, location, teams, etc.)
