	What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung
around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman
get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do
you have to do?  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should
be in the hall...  God.  Pretty soon you'll be saying that Cal Ripken doesn't
deserve to be in the Hall.  Then, I'll flame you. :-)
