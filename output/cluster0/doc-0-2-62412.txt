Ok, so you have proven you saw the right stuff.  However, as I said above,
it takes politics and PR to keep the bucks coming.
"No politics, no bucks, no buck rogers."

Yes this may be true in the case of the SCIENCE data coming from the spacecraft
and other stuff about the operations.  However, there is still stuff regarding
regular operation that belongs to the company and they have ever legal right
to keeping it theirs.  But this does not mean that everything can or
should be swept under the umbrella of company proprietory data.

You can do the same here...you just have to wait a year.
