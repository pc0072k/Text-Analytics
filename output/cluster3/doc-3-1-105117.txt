Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three
years.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but
when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat.
He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but
he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York
ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I
believe.  
I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot
it around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance,
he could become extremely productive.  I don't have any stats
to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would
cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has
this year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for
Jim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get
the job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation
with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  I
think he might have realized something when the Marlins
or Rockies didn't select him.
The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now.
Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen?
Ouch.  I'm praying that the BP will return to last year's
form....
