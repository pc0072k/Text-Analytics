There are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to
state something as fact.  Baseball is not one of them.

Therefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last
year, and Larkin was better than Griffin.  No, I can't ascertain this.
I can't prove it.  But I'm not required to do so.

And since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless,
why don't you simply stay out of them?
