Oops!  I came across this file from last year.  Thought you might
enjoy some of these thoughts.  The predictions were made on the

You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees
all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins
dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive
calculation, I thought this did pretty well.

Hm.  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker.  And Bielecki
wasn't released until the end of the year.  I won't comment on the
bullpen.  (Jeff Reardon???  :-)

Right on Blauser.  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early on
Lonnie, as with Bielecki.  Didn't pick Sanders.  (Did anybody? :-)

>3. Managers to be fired this year (1992) in chronological order:

Three of them went, right?  Showalter is still around (and likely to
stick, it seems).

Nope!  They won the division, and so kept him for a shot at the
playoffs.

>2) Mets win division

:-)  Well, they didn't finish last.

Got that one right.

>4) Yankees surprise everyone, but finish second behind Toronto.

Nope.

>5) Dwight Gooden wins 20, but is surpassed by Saberhagen who wins 22.

I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win, huh?

Tsk Tsk.  Not nice to predict something like this.

>7) Strawberry fails to hit even 20 home runs and is often injured.

You got that right!

So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed.  :-)  I
was at least *close*, and was right about Jefferies.  (Though I don't
know.  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade?)

>6) Roger Clemens wins another CY, as well as 20 games.

Close.  No cigar.

Sometimes us statheads get lucky.  Grace *didn't* hit behind Dawson
the entire season, but he also finished with only 79 RBIs.

Nope.  He slowed down, and the injury finished him off.  Didn't
even reach 50.  But a ballsy prediction, nonetheless.

The Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20 (though
Mussina might have had a chance, with better relief and more starts).

Except for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians
"led" with 76 wins, the Red Sox "trailed" with 73 wins.  None were
horrible, but four were five or more games below .500.

He had 211 IP, but didn't win the Cy Young.  Maddux surprised all.

>2. The Orioles will win 88+ games in at least 3 of the next 6 years

I don't think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games last
year, and they were fifth in the league in ERA.  Not a bad start.

Looks like it.  He wasn't bad last year, just too consistent to be an
ace.  So far this year looks like more of the same.

I honestly can't say.  Did they get rid of him?  Their BB totals were
down last year.

I just don't think he's that good....

:-)  So far, so good.  I'm *definitely* not waiting to check this one.

Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief.  He has a
rubber arm and unusual delivery.  He might be decent in that role.

Belle hit 34 HR last year, walking 52 times (but five of those were
intentional!).  Okay, so I exaggerate.  But I *might* have been right.

How much did Cal sign for?  When did he sign?  If I remember
correctly, he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season.
