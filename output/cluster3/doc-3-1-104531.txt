This just in...

Nolan Ryan hurt his right knee in the 4th inning of the Rangers-Orioles
game last night.  He'll be having arthoscopic surgery that will, at best,
keep him on the DL for two to five weeks.

Just when I had almost convinced myself that the Rangers' rotation would
stay healthy this year...
