	COuld he?  And the first three that died, when guns ablazing in came
	the BATF and FBI?

	I imagine I would have some trouble giving up my children to
	someone who had just shot -- what -- two of them?

	NB:  It takes two sets of guns in a situation like this.

>Yes, I put the blame on Koresh and similar fanatical religious
>leaders that think more about their cause than about keeping

	Fanatical:  those whowill not tolerate another's way of life
	Religious:  Based on emotional, internal, or otherwise
		lacking in commonly defined _scientific_ basis,
		including legal ones, such as this old saw:

			Innocent untilproven guilty

		not
			Innocent until presumed guilty

	Who is the fanatic?  Note who is dead; this usually bespeaks
	a fair bit for the idea that the OTHER side also had lethal
	weapons, used fatally.

		They are dead:  the children.
			At best Koresh was an asshole and the government
			criminally negligent in its hadni\ling of the case.

			At worst, Koresh and his followers were
				innocent
				not brainwashed
				guilty of illegal arms possession
					(as yet unproven)
				and murderedd
				along with 25 children
			They cannot speak for themselves
			Members of the (surviving, alive, and not burned
				to death) BATF/FBI can, and are
				inappropriately
				to the public eye
				outside the bounds of their legal authorities
					read the charter:
					the Constitution specifies that
					the COURTS convict, while the
					enforcement arm INVESTIGATES,
					and that the evidence involved
					shuld not be disseminated in a
					way to harm or injure a party
					involved prior to that action;
					its called slander or libel
					(even where factually true butthen
					distoted or disseminated with intent
					to harm
				for the purpose of covering their butts

			because the bottom line is:
				they SAID they wanted the kids to get out
					alive
				and theFBI, the BATF, Ms. Reno, the Prez,
					and EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS

						SICK
						SELFSERVING
						GROUP OF UPRIGHT ANIMALS
					that used to be a freedom loving
					peaceful country called

						America:  look up the name,
						it might surprise you
				has turned the "point the finger of blame"
				on the OTHER guy.
			
				and LET THOSE KIDS DIE.

				Note well:  they lived 51 days; they only
				died when attacked by outside force.

			SPock's World, Diane Duane:

				The spear in the heart of another
				is the spear in your own ....

		ALL of us are responsible.

		Iam; you are.  The question is not whether, but how:

			Guess what:  you get to make up your own mind
			on that.

>children out from the war zone. I'm not ashamed of this statement.

	Who created the war zone?  You should be ashamed of bypassing that.
	It's the same damned (Literally) comment made by the folks in
	the former Yugoslavia to justify Ethnic Cleansing:

		"Gee, they had the guns, all they had to do was surrender".

>
>To justify other means does not eliminate the fact that children
>died for a cause that they should not have been part of. 

	Whose "cause" did they die for?  The one where they lived,
	peacibly, to all known purposes (until proven in COurt,
	folks!), or the Cuase of Righteous Government SafeGuarding 
	The Freedom Of The CHildren

		Who are now dead.


	AgainI say:

		I do NOT know who did what
		I was NOT there.
		The FBI leaders show moral SICKness trying to
			convict in the press ahead of schedule
		And you should look over your shoulder,

		becuase if there is anything my ruminations that
		actually  sets onto real fact of what happened

			and I do not know that; I am defending
			people who ahving been burned to death cannot
			speak for themselves

		you may, in 22-5 years, find that the concept in our
		Court system  has gone from

			Due Processss

		to

			Due Profit

		and the BATF come to collect their fair share of the tax
		on the value of your house if you rented it for income

			which is going down now, folks.
			Read Bankruptcy 1995
				Its accurate in figures
				and it bypasses the greedy
					businessman and
					mankers who have
				taken profit from the corruption
				of our govbernment.

			Look to where the money went, folks.

			You  got $10 for medicare that paid a doctor for
			$00.50 worth of medicine.

				This is the customaryprofitmargin
				to businessmen for goernment entitlements.

	Who wll own the land of the cult now?  Note well:  it WAS nonproift,
	religious, and nontaxable.  Large tract of land .... hmmm.

	Use your brains, folks:  it happened Germany, and it can happen
	here.
			4.3 trillion (admitted) and counting....
