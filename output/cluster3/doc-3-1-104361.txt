DEAD WRONG!  Last time I checked, Jim Fregosi was still managing the
Phillies, and doing quite a fine job thank you...best record in
baseball at 8-1

MY PREDICTION FOR 1993:
Jim Fregosi will win manager of the year in the NL

(don't flame me..flame the bum who thinks he got fired last year.
PAY ATTENTION KIDDO!)
